		  <p>My first rememberence of anything German was in grade school and had a teacher who
             told us about herself growing up in Germany and moving to America. She Taught us how the
			 standard greetings, hellows and good byes. Being as excited as I was with these new sounding
			 words, I went right home and told my dad. He informed me that we had german ancesters in our
			 family tree somewhere down the line. I have been extremely intruiged about the country and
			 language ever since. In highschool I finally had the oppertunity to take a language class
			 and German was the first pick. After a school year of learning, I started to loose interest
			 in school all together. My teen years were a time of exploration for me and took a different
			 class instead of the second year language course. Of course, as an adult I have a few words
             to say to the younger me, but thats a more private issue. 	<br><br>				
		    I have however, taken a few moments of spare time over the last few years to not only re-learn,
			 but also kept up on and continue to learn more German. With all of  the technology thats available
             these days I came accross Duolingo in about 2017-2018ish. There have been periods that I wouldn't
			 use the app for a few weeks until I lost my first longest day streak of 78ish days. I was upset but
			 eventually, I got over it and now I've raised that bar to over 250 days. As far as proficency Im 1/2
			 way through the A1 section of their curriculum. I personally feel, while this app does boost learning
			 its tends to be very passive-agressive lol If you know, you know.<br><br>
            I do fully intend to keep up on the progress I've made and try to incorperate using the language, a<br>
			 little bit more in my daily life to help with retention.</p>
