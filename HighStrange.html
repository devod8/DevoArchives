      <p>In this modern era we have studied and classified a vast ammount of different subjects related to our percieved
reality. There are however events that take place in this existance that still remain unexplainable. They tend to be
experienced by individual humans and usually leave the witness with a life altering effect. There are occasions where multiple 
people witness the same event or even their own perception of the event. The list is on going of stories and tales told from
all points in our human history of anomalous happenings. The unfortunate reality of scociety as a whole is that we rely heavily
on science as a base line for truth. Therefore these accounts are difficult for many to comprehend because there is usually a
lack of physical evidence to be studdied. The evidence that is found is usually not looked at as admissable and that can be for 
a couple different reasons. Lack of prior classification to compair new evidence samples against. Government intervention for 
"National Security" purposes. Outright denial or confirmation bias.<br>I am willing to state that God and Jesus of the Holey 
Bible and all within is on one of the oldest and highest pedestals in the department of strange, for us human beings. I make no 
claim against or for the validity of religon in general. But we only have scrpiture as physical evidence according to science.
