		  <p>In my free time throughout my life I have spent time learning a
		  a few different languages. In my youth the internet was in its infancy,
		  but was a mysterious and captivating new space. Though it took like 15
		  minutes to actually get connected, and the standard website formats
		  were basic and janky to todays standards, and an incoming call could
         	 kick you offline at any time, there were some advantages that came from
		  the experience. The information highway!<br><br>
         	 It was the mid '90 a cousin had a computer at her house and also had
		  AOL 2.0 (America Online). There was a disc involved and all the affore
		  mentioned and I was hooked. We didnt get a computer in out house hold
	          for a few years, and when we did it was not the latest modle. Windows
		  '98	was new and we got a Windows '95. It was enough for me to learn
		  more about computers. Before this in school we did have a
		  copmuter/typing class. Sometimes the teacher would let us play Oregon
		  Trail,Kidpix or like Mathblasters. We were all learning how to
		  communicate through the keyboard.<br><br>
		  Later in my highschool days I found myself taking up German as well
		  as getting into a webdesign class. Below is more info into the different
		  languages, how that came to be and how its been comming along.</p>
