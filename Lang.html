		  <p>In my free time throughout my life I have spent time learning a
		  a few different languages. In my youth the internet was in its infancy,
		  but was a mysterious and captivating new space. Though it took like 15
		  minutes to actually get connected, and the standard website formats
		  were basic and janky to todays standards, and an incoming call could
         	 kick you offline at any time, there were some advantages that came from
		  the experience. The information highway!<br><br>
         	 It was the mid '90 a cousin had a computer at her house and also had
		  AOL 2.0 (America Online). There was a disc involved and all the affore
		  mentioned and I was hooked. We didnt get a computer in out house hold
	          for a few years, and when we did it was not the latest modle. Windows
		  '98	was new and we got a Windows '95. It was enough for me to learn
		  more about computers. Before this in school we did have a
		  copmuter/typing class. Sometimes the teacher would let us play Oregon
		  Trail,Kidpix or like Mathblasters. We were all learning how to
		  communicate through the keyboard.<br><br>
		  Later in my highschool days I found myself taking up German as well
		  as getting into a webdesign class. Below is more info into the different
		  languages, how that came to be and how its been comming along.</p>

			<p>My first rememberence of anything German was in grade school and had a teacher who
			   told us about herself growing up in Germany and moving to America. She Taught us how to say the
			   standard greetings, hellows and good byes. Being as excited as I was with these new sounding
			   words, I went right home and told my dad. He informed me that we had german ancesters in our
			   family tree somewhere down the line. I have been extremely intruiged about the country and
			   language ever since. In highschool I finally had the oppertunity to take a language class
			   and German was the first pick. After a school year of learning, I started to loose interest
			   in school all together. My teen years were a time of exploration for me and took a different
			   class instead of the second year language course. Of course, as an adult I have a few words
			   to say to the younger me, but thats a more private issue. 	<br><br>				
			  I have however, taken a few moments of spare time over the last few years to not only re-learn,
			   but also kept up on and continue to learn more German. With all of  the technology thats available
			   these days I came accross Duolingo in about 2017-2018ish. There have been periods that I wouldn't
			   use the app for a few weeks until I lost my first longest day streak of 78ish days. I was upset but
			   eventually, I got over it and now I've raised that bar to over 250 days. As far as proficency Im 1/2
			   way through the A1 section of their curriculum. I personally feel, while this app does boost learning
			   its tends to be very passive-agressive lol If you know, you know.<br><br>
			  I do fully intend to keep up on the progress I've made and try to incorperate using the language, a<br>
			   little bit more in my daily life to help with retention.</p>
