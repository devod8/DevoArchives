        We had the pleasure of fixing this one from California. This car came to us
        after being in a literal fender bender. Being that this car had already been
        customized, we knew this would be a delicate operation. Damages required repair
        to the front bumper, valance pan, driver fender, hood, passenger fender, and
        low on the right rear portion of the quarter panel. There was alot of filler
        work on this body so we had to remove materials in the damaged areas, fix the
        sheet metal as needed, aply new filler and bodywork. The color on this one is
        absolutly beautiful, but was a chore to nail. All in all the car was blended
        all around to do right by the car.<br><br>
        In the final weeks before completing this vehicle, the owner unexpectedly
        passed away. He was in his mid thirties and survived by his loving wife and
        daughters. Now we here love cars and strive to take on customers who have the
        same love. It was a pleasure to have had the opertunaty to know him and an 
        honor to have had the opertunaty to fix his Beautiful car, and our deepest
        condolences go to his Family.<br>
