<p style="border-radius:30px; padding: 4;"><br><br>
 I oppened my eyes so fast with out warning or thought. I don't know what triggered my sudden awaking other than the fact that it's Christmas. 
 I focus on my bed room window and see that the sun wasn't even up yet. It was still dark but no longer the pitch of midnight. Knowing that it 
 was Christmas day prevented me from returning back to sleep. The curriosity provoked motivation to go see if Santa came!<br><br>

Tossing the covers off me I lightly slide out of bed  and begin sneaking out of my bedroom. I noticed the kitchen light was off indicating that 
Mom and Dad must still be sleeping. They did't do anything befor brewing coffee first thing in the morning. As I round the corner exiting the 
kitchen I slowly poke my head out to see if any one was out in the living room. "Nobodys up yet, Im the first one" I think to myself as I tip 
toe futher into the living room to see the coffee table where we had left a plate of cookies and a cup of milk for Santa. Next to it was a note 
my brother Tom and I had writen the night before asking Santa for an autograph. But nothing had been disturbed.<br><br>

I went over to the tree to inspect the presents  only to see the same few that Mom and Dad put there a couple of days ago. I was confused, sad 
and disappointed. Just staring at the unchanged environment wondering if I was in fact a Good Boy this last year. Why hadn't Santa visited us? A 
tear slipped out of the corner of my eye, tickling my check. I sat on the couch and let the feelings wash over me. Maybe that time I called Tom 
"Dumbo" because he has big ears. Or the time I got him introuble for taking the last of the cookies, even though I did. What if it was something 
far worse than being naughty or nice? What if it was much deeper like what Billy from my class said. He said His older brother is in the Sixth 
grade and says that it's all a lie. There is no NorthPole. There is no Reindeer. There is no Elfs. There is no Santa. I thought that was just 
another move of his, being the class bully and all. I just thought, well of course Santa exists. He is just an ugly bully. Well hes not really a 
bully but he looks like one.<br><br>

I burry my head into one of the pillows and  weep as quietly as I could. After a few minutes I must have fallen back asleep because I was now 
dreaming that my family was lost outside in the snow and freezing. It was sunset and I was trying to find them to give them handwarmers that I had. 
I rememberd crying there too. My tears kept freezing and turning into Eye sicles. I thought it was a silly pun too, even for a dream. I had all 
these Eye sicles around me making it hard to walk, not to unlike a couple feet of snow will do. As I was feeling the frustration of this seemingly 
loosing battle, I began to hear jingling in the blury haze of the snowy slurry that blundered my abilaties of sight and mobility. At first they were 
coming from ahead of me and then behind me. As I spun around to find the source of the noise, the jingling became more discernable and sounded like 
chains. Eventually the sound was swirling around me from all directions. Just as I felt like I was having a sensory over load, a new sound came into 
focus. The unmistake able sound of the snow crunching under the wait of something taking a step. And another. And another, even closer. I was 
whipping my head around in circles to try and spy the maker of this aproach, but nothing. And as if standing behind me, something of the horned game 
type let out a Grunt and surge of hot air on the back of my neck and in my right ear. This caused every muscle in my body to contract and convulse 
in fright almost as if I had been shot.<br><br>

Before I could let out a scream I woke up. Im in the living room on the couch still. The sun was just rising and starting to shoot beams of gold 
warm light through the cracks of the blinds of the windows. they were bouncing off a few ornaments turning the livingroom into a circus of colors 
and light. It was quiet. Once my senses came too I surveyed the room. I notice the cookie plate now only held two cookies and one had a bite taken 
out of it. I gasped and leaned forword to inspect the cup. There was probably only a swig or two left. That sent me back into the couch in 
astaunishment as I let out a small yip in excitement. I looked at the tree to be completely amazed at the beautiful sight. Presents stacked upon 
presents all around the tree. I couldn't even reach the tree there were so many. But right up in the front was a book for me with a big bow on it. 
It was a Mickey Mouse book; The Prince and the Pauper. I opened the book and a folded peice of paper fell out with what looked like a thin shaving 
of birch bark. I picked up the paper and opened it revealing it was the note Tom and I had left. There was no autograph from santa. Just a bloody 
looking dirty hoof print.<br><br></p>

   <br><br>1997<br><br>

   Baseball.<br><br>

   Americas pastime.<br><br>

   I wipe the sweat from my brow as the sun staired down. The bill of my ballcap is rendered useless as the sun is 
   just above eye level. I'm only playing catch with my buddy Dan, but it's a fun challenge. Were playing along the 
   firstbase line just off the feild.<br><br>

   It is the end of the season and me and my team are having a Banquet to celebrate our run in the final tournament. 
   We dominated all summer. We were second in the league only but only because we missed one of the first couple games.<br><br>
   Chicken pox.<br><br>

   Im only 8 but I'm good at the game. I was constantly overhearing the other adults making comments back and forth 
   "He's a natural!", "'Raw talent' in that one" some would say.<br><br>

   My dad taught me everything I know. He was a coach himself and had played since he was a boy. He even took me to see 
   a few Mariners games at the the 'King Dome'. Edgar Martinez, Alex Rodriguez, Randy Johnson, Jay Buhner...Ken Griffey 
   Jr! They were living legends.  Baseball was my thing.<br><br>

   Dan tossed the ball to me and I held my glove just below eye sight. I adjusted my body a little and 'THWAP' the ball 
   struck the palm of my mit. "Good Throw Dan. Excellent aim!" I say scooping the ball up with my free hand. I warn "Comin'
    in HOT!" as I wrenched my arm back and unloaded a fastball in his direction.<br>'THWAAP!'<br><br>
   "Good catch!"<br>
   I was having a blast. I couldn't wait to eat! The adults were setting up the food tables.<br><br>

   "Pop Fly!" Screamed Dan as he lanched the ball into the sun.<br><br>

   The food smelt so good. I hadn't eaten at all that just so I could have room for everything. Mac n 
   Cheese, mashed patatoes, BBQ chicken, burgers, dogs. My mouth watered in anticipation. I was planning 
   on eating like a king this evening.<br><br>

   I was so lost in the smell that I hadn't heard the warning crys from a couple adults. I was trying to stay ahead of that 
   ball. I couldn't really see it but I knew its flight path. It would come into view and I'll be right under it.<br><br>

   Just as the ball finally came into view I was correct I was right under it. I reached my hand up in time for the bal to 
   fall right into the leather.<br><br>

   Before I could relish in my victory emulating catch, I'm jared with such stoping force my head hurts. I'm beyond confused 
   as my vision is not working correctly. Everything is dizzying and hard to make out or focus. The pain in my head was getting
    mor intense and more percise. My hearing was impaired to a degree. It sounded like I was under and I could hear screaming 
    but it was muffled.<br><br>

   I tried to speak but I was incappable. I realized at that moment that the pain was radiating from my mouth. I let out a 
   deep groan in panic and pain. My eyes were swelling up with tears but my vision came to and I'm tangled in the aluminium 
   side line bleachers.<br><br>

   The cold metal shocked the rest of my body's senses back into order and I fall back to the ground as my dad flys from out 
   of no where to console me. The pain was so intese at this point and I felt like I was drooling alot. As painfull as this 
   was it was also extreamly embarrasing. I couldn't control my bodily functions properly. Trying to walk would have been 
   impossible had my mom not made it to me. Some how she levitated me away from the impact site.<br><br>

   I passed one of my teammates and saw the look of horror in his face as he pointed at me and said "I've never seen that 
   much blood in my life!"<br><br>

   My eyes widened as I look down at my hands cupped under my mouth to see the thickest red syrup like liquid I've seen this 
   close. Bright red flooded my hand like an overflowing tube. My mouth was like a leaky sink dripping into a bucket. The sun 
   light peirced it causing it to shimmer vibrantly. Mesmerizing!<br><br>

   Unfortunately I didn't get to eat like a king that evening and wouldn't even eat normal for the next few weeks and months 
   with all the surgeries.<br><br>

<p style="border-radius:30px; padding: 4;"><br><br>
When I was young my grandparents lived in a very nice old country home, just out side of town. The property must have only 
been a few acres but as a child I imagined it to be much, much larger. My grand father came from a long line of Sweedish and 
Norwegian farmers. Himself being of the second generation born in America. He would tell me stories and tales of the home 
land, passed on to him by his grandfather.
<br><br>
   The front lawn was perfectly manicured. The side yard that wraped around to the back yard was also very neatly kept. I 
   rather enjoyed the appearence of their house. From the outside it was very warm and inviting. The Triming was a soft brown 
   that looked very comforting above the white siding. The front entrance way was accompanied with a flowerpot growing a 
   sunflower that was as tall as me at the time. Yellow as the sun.
<br><br>
   The front door was red and had an old horseshoe door knocker. Just inside was the front room and it was very cosey. The stone 
   fireplace warmed the wood pannled walls. The carpet was plush and felt as if you were stepping on a cloud. Soft on impact but 
   almost springy on take off. I couldnt speak much on the comfortablity of the couches as us kids were not allowed to sit on 
   them. They were wraped in clear plastic but they looked beautiful with their vintage floral patttern and hand carved wood frame.
<br><br>
   The kitchen was through some french doors in the next room. It was open and was shared with the dining room. They had a very 
   lovely cabnet with very fancy plates and silverware. Past the kitchen was a small hallway that led to a mud room/laundry room 
   at the back of the house. At the halfway point of hallway was a bathroom to the left and to the right was a stairway leading 
   down to the basement and guest room.
<br><br>
   They had some interesting old, and very odd things down their. Lots of antiques; tables, chairs, dressers, Paintings, wooden
   hand carved scupltures; a large grandfather clock. It was a trove of mysterious belongings from unknown origins. The power of 
   curiosity in a place like that is almost debilitating to a child. One day my brother found me playing with Lincoln logs in the 
   front room on the floor saying "Hey" under his breath quietly. "I foun' somethin' on  the stairs. Com'on I wanna show you!"
<br><br>
   Like the pied piper and the spell that was cast on all the children in the town. I was compelled to follow. The air began to feel 
   still as we crossed the thresh hold from front room to kitchen to hall way and half way down the stairs. It was so quiet. My 
   brother pointed at a flag that was hung on the wall and a sign that hung above it that looked handmade and privative. There were 
   words chiseled into the face but they didn't look like English. Their were some letters and symbols that I didn't recognize. The 
   flag was a red background with a sideways blue cross and had a white border around the cross. As I got older I learned this was a 
   Norwegian flag from the 1800s.
<br><br>
   My brother grabbed the bottom corners of the flag lifting them up to reveal a small door not much bigger than myself. He looked at
    me and I stared back for a moment before he opened the door. A surge of cold, smelly, old, nasty air waffled out from the blackness 
    inside. We both groan in repulse trying desperately not to vomit. Once we settled my brother said "Climb on in, lets check it out." 
    As I reluctantly climbed in I tried to let my eyes adjust to the darkness. I scanned the crawl space of the house until I noticed 
    something move out of the corner of my eye and I refocused on an odd looking figure in the dark. It Lurched forward in my direction 
    and growled at me just as the light behind me was snuffed out from the little door slammed shut. For the moment I was paralyzed. 
    Completely strangled with fear. This Thing made a few thumping noise and sounds like something rustling around, getting closer. In 
    this moment I regained functionality of my body and mind and began banging and hitting on the door with every ounce of desperation.
<br><br>
   The only two thoughts that flooded my mind was one of certainty and one of uncertainty. I was certain at this point that the sign 
   above the door was a warning in a much older language of some unholy creature from some nightmare in this waking world "Do Not 
   Enter!" The uncertain thought was more of a question. Was this terrible blood curdling scream that reverberated through my ears 
   into my skull and rattling my soul, coming from this unknown horror or was it coming from me?<br><br>

   Every day for as long as I can recall in my life,
   I would inspect the condition of the world outside my bed room window. I open my eyes and lift 
   the covers off of me as I swing my legs off the side of the bed "What kind of day is it going 
   to be?" I think to myself letting my toes touch the floor before resting my feet all of the way 
   onto the cold hard wood floor and stand up. "What kind of clothes should I wear today?" I wonder 
   grabbing the thick heavy curtins that block all light. As I draw them back I'm no longer cut off 
   from the wounderful beauty that awaits outside.
<br><br>
   I rub my chin as I ask myself "What shall I do today?" I feel alive seeing the sky and the 
   scattered clouds drifting freely. Seeing the birds fly from bush to bush and then landing on the 
   grass, pecking for worms. Retreating back to the trees off of the property. I sigh deeply when 
   I think "Why don't they visit my apple tree? It is old but it is large. There is plenty of space 
   for families of birds. My apple tree is beautiful. Its my absolute favorite tree.
<br><br>
   My Father built the tool shed that sits under the apple tree. Theres alot of tools in there. 
   I spend alot of time in the tool shed. I have friends but none of them want to spend time with me 
   in the tool shed. Theres a lot of space in there. No one ever wants to stay and play. They all want 
   to leave and "This is my favorite place in the world" I pleed with them but they always try to leave. 
   They are scared of my tool shed for some reason. They think it's scary. I dont want them to leave.
   <br><br>        <img src="images/Fruits.png" class="rounded-image"><br><br>
   They cry in the night usually. I think they have nightmares. Maybe if the birds would visit 
   the apple tree, my friends would be happy to stay. Maybe my friends wouldnt cry or have nightmares 
   anymore. They would see how beautiful the birds are and how wounderfully they sing. If only they 
   would be quiet long enough for the birds would visit. "Its really a lovely apple tree" I tell myself 
   as I watch the apple tree craddle the tool shed with all my friends waiting inside. "What a lovely 
   view to start the day!" I admire as I proceed to get dressed and go about my day...<br><br>

Big Sky Montana!
<br><br>
What a lovely place! It holds onto an older way of living in certain areas, still carrying on from a 
time when it was a new lifestyle for many. From hunting and fishing to log cabins, ranches, farms, and 
homesteads, to the development of mountain roads, mining, railways, bridges, and highways that eventually 
led to cities.
<br><br>
My Aunt lived in Gardiner, on the southern border of Montana, just outside the northwest corner of Wyoming. 
On one visit during my boyhood, it had snowed a couple of days prior. I was surprised, feeling silly for 
assuming it didn't snow there because I usually visited in the spring or summer. There was only an inch or 
two, but it was enough to create a magical sight.
<br><br>
She stayed in an old log cabin nestled on the hillside of the mountain enveloping this small town. It was 
serene up there. We arrived late at night, so we settled in, making ourselves comfortable and exploring 
the cabin. I was there with my older brother, two cousins, and my two aunts. As a fourth-grader, I was an 
incredibly curious boy. Unraveling the mysteries of a new place was like an adventure that drove me to 
discover its truths. We called it a night as the midnight hour approached.
<br><br>
It was a strange new place. At times, in a half-waking stupor, I'd notice the mounted animal heads on 
the wall and momentarily panic. Drifting back to sleep, I'd encounter strange dreams, each more bizarre 
and ominous than the last. Eventually, the sound of birds chirping signaled the imminent sunrise. I gave 
up trying to sleep and fixed myself some toasted Pop-Tarts and a glass of orange juice while everyone else 
slumbered.
<br><br>
I ventured outside to further explore the property, now that visibility had improved with the melting 
snow. Circling around to the back, I inspected the yard enclosed by its barbed wire fence. At the front, 
across the road, an awe-inspiring view down the mountain overlooking Gardiner awaited. The ground was 
littered with massive boulders, some as large as five feet in every dimension. I clambered onto one and 
began hopping from boulder to boulder. After a few minutes, I started sweating and decided to tie my coat 
around my waist.
<br><br>
Continuing on, my coat gradually loosened and eventually slipped off, falling between a few rocks. 
Retrieving it, I paused to relish the view once more before heading back to the cabin. As I turned 
to step onto the next rock, I suddenly found myself falling face-first. I attempted to brace myself
with my hands, but it was to little effect.
<br><br>
In a haze of confusion, I brought my hands to my face, cushioning most of the impact. The pain 
hadn't struck yet. Thankfully, there was no blood. I cautiously inspected the inside of my mouth
 with my tongue, only to be filled with absolute terror as I encountered something sharp at the 
 front. I exclaimed, "I broke off half of my darn tooth!"<br><br>

     The unrelenting wind tore through the bed of the pickup truck, hurtling down the deserted road. Above, 
     stars twinkled, a stark contrast to the chaos below. My eyes stung against the gusts, threatening tears. 
     Amidst the turmoil, uncertainty gripped me—I couldn't discern if I held my breath intentionally or if fear 
     stole it involuntarily.
<br><br>
Nate's terror mirrored mine, etched with the same dread. In the darkness, isolation surrounded us, marked only 
by trees lining the desolate road.
<br><br>
Desperation pushed me to sit up, straining to peer through the rear window into the cab. Two figures sat 
ominously in the front seats, features obscured by the dashboard glow. The speedometer needle danced erratically 
at 90 mph, a chilling reminder of our perilous velocity.
A jolt seized the truck as we hit a bump, sending me sprawling. Fingers grasped for purchase, seeking anything 
to anchor myself against hurtling into the night.
<br><br>
But there was nothing. I glanced back at Nate, his demeanor shifted, frozen in a catatonic state, detached 
from imminent danger. His gaze skyward, clutching his chest, seemed disconnected. I sought solace or guidance 
in the stars but found only questions in the chaos.
<br><br>
The truck steadied, Nate's trembling hand found mine, offering solace amidst the harrowing journey. His eyes 
conveyed fear and determination. We had to take control, to escape our captors and end this nightmare.
<br><br>
Summoning courage, I whispered Nate's name, lost in the wind. He felt my urgency and nodded. Together, we planned 
to make a break for it. Minutes turned to hours as the truck thundered on. We endured weather, terrain, and 
challenges but never lost sight of freedom.
<br><br>
One fateful night, rounding a bend, Nate spotted an opening between towering trees, their branches reaching 
out. We braced for change. With determination, we launched from the truck, bodies hitting the ground with echoing 
thuds. Pain seared through us, but adrenaline fueled our escape.
<br><br>
We ran, each step propelling us closer to freedom. Pursuit sounds faded, and a small clearing welcomed us. 
Collapsing onto the ground, we gasped for respite, holding blades of grass like life elixirs.
<br><br>
And then, just as we exhaled relief, we heard it—the distant revving of an engine. Panic seized us. The truck 
emerged from the woods. We weren't escaping this harbinger of an unknown horror.<br><br>

         He was trying to focus on his tasks but could not let the intrusive thoughts go. He isn't often 
         like this. He's usualy a fairly well tempered man but the thoughts that he could not get out of 
         his head were the thoughts of dont think about those thoughts.
<br><br>
   The thoughts slip in like an unwanted guest at the most inconveinient time. The power of sugestion 
   reflects the tones that reverberate in his mind. A car strayed off of a road and tares through an 
   award winning flower bed of a HOA Board members front yard. A Bowling ball strikes an unaware couples
   picknic in a park leaving nothing but crumbs of a perfectly planed day between two lovers. 
   The winning lato ticket remained in the hand of a man on his way to claim his new found fortune 
   until his murderer pealed it from his fading warm hand. A child feeling the fear creep in as her 
   parents cloose the bed room door after saying good night and the shadows start dancing around in 
   the night. A lone soldier seperated from his squad, crawling through the brush of a forest in a 
   foreign country stumbled right into the enemys base.
<br><br>
   He's one out of 7 billion who experience situations that can send the human mind to the darkest 
   depths. Far deeper than the deepest oceans. Far more truamatic than any external apocalypse. Its 
   the internal apocalypse. The kind of rapture that is experienced on an individual level. Its one 
   that has no Army, no forgiveness, no empathy, no company. It comes and goes as it pleases like 
   an astranged lover looking for another body to add to their list. The kind that becomes worse the 
   more one attempts to evade it like a chinese finger trap.
<br><br>
   The secret is not to evade but to embrace. You can not break the ankles of thought. You must 
   understand its origins. You must lean into the firm hug the mind creates. Thoughts come and 
   go like the tide. You can only ride the wave or go under it. Going under is the thought of 
   escape. Riding is acceptence and adaptablity. Much like the wave we come and go. No Rock or 
   shore can stop the wave from lapping over and over. It has always been and since the earth 
   formed.  Life walked out of that water because it rode the wave instead of going under it.
<br><br>
  Thoughts opperate this way. Attempt to evade and you will be consumed. Embrace and it will 
  carry you to a new salvation. The thought will do the oposite of the attempted attention its given.
